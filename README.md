Arduino Studio
==============

* Arduino is an open-source tool used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a micro-controller) and a development environment that allow you to run, write and upload computer code to the board.

* Arduino Studio is a new open source development environment for the Arduino Programming Language. Instead of a monolithic architecture and a centralized development model, Arduino Studio take advantage of Adobe Brackets  Editor's pluggable system. We are working hard to allow users to exploit Arduino Studio as stand-alone, web/cloud-based and on-board embedded editor. Just one editor for all the environments. 
Arduino Studio is now available as an alpha release, in-bundle distribution for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows or as a easy-to-install Brackets Extension.

Features
--------

* Take advantage of Brackets editor's architecture;
* One editor for all environments: Cloud-based on your browser, Stand-alone on your PC and Embedded on your board;
* Written in Javascript and Node.js as Brackets extensions or as a stand-alone software;
* Brand new User Interface;
* Code Completion and in-line Quick Language Reference;

Work in progress
----------------

* Community plugin manager. Contributed Themes, additional Functionalities and Libraries are welcome!
* Platform manager for third parties boards, architectures and toolchains;

Installation
------------
Ready-to-run software and instructions are available on [Labs](http://labs.arduino.org/tiki-index.php?page=Arduino+Studio)

[Arduino.org](http://arduino.org) IDE is at this time developed, maintained and supported by the Arduino.org team: [support@arduino.org](mailto:support@arduino.org)

Credits
--------
[Arduino.org](http://arduino.org) is an open source project, developed by many and based on:

Arduino uses the [GNU avr-gcc toolchain](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/avr-gcc), [avrdude](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/), [avr-libc](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/), and code from
[Processing](http://www.processing.org) and [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co).
